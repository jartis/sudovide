# Sudovide

## What

Sudovide (soo-doh-vaid) is a puzzle game about dividing (-vide) a solved Sudoku (sudo-) into irregular groups. The solution clues given are *NOT* guaranteed to have 3x3 squares with the digits 1-9 uniquely, but there are contiguous regions that contain the digits once. 

Use the mouse to drag and extend regions from the starting clues to mark out these regions. Click on a cell that is already in a group to remove its group. Clues given at the start are in white - these cannot change groups.
